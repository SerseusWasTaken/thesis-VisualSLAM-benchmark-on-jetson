# Supplementary data and code for master thesis "Benchmark and Comparison of Visual SLAM Algorithms for Resource-Constrained Platforms in Mobile Robotics" 
This repository contains additional data and the scripts used for the thesis. 
## Folders 
### Benchmarks
The [benchmarks](/benchmarks/) folder contains all raw data obtained during the benchmark. 
### Evaluation
The [evaluation](/evaluation/) folder contains excel files which were used for evaluation. There is a file per algorithm and per sequence.  
### Scripts
The [scripts](/scripts/) folder contains any scripts used for the benchmark and evaluation. That is scripts for benchmark execution, pre-processing, and changing data into a processable format.
